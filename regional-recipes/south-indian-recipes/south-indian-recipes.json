This lacy dosa is very easy to make at home because it doesn’t require any fermentation process like other dosas. Batter for this dosa is prepared by grinding soaked rice and then adding water to it to get watery consistency. Then the dosa is prepared by pouring the watery batter over hot tawa like making rava dosa and not like making the plain dosa in which the batter is spread. To make the neer dosa at home, follow this recipe with step by step photos and enjoy it with coconut chutney or sambar or vegetable saagu or with the mixture of jaggery and grated fresh coconut.",

In this recipe, we have used steel cut oats, however you can use any other type of oats (steel cut, rolled or instant) based on availability since the oats are grounded into coarse powder and because of that it doesn’t make any difference on texture of steamed idlis.

        "description": "Akki Roti, a soft-n-crispy flatbread made with rice flour, grated carrot, onion and basic Indian spices, is one of the best ways to start your day. It is very popular in Karnataka where Akki means rice in Kannada and hence it is known as Akki Roti (Rice Roti). It is very easy to prepare and takes only 15-20 minutes – first a soft dough is prepared by mixing rice flour with vegetables, spices and water, flattened into thin round shaped disc, and cooked on tawa until crisp and light brown. Traditional preparation of this Rice Roti requires flattening the dough directly on hot tawa. However, it is a difficult process and has risk of burning your fingers accidentally. This Akki Roti Recipe uses an innovative Parchment Paper technique that allows you to roll dough into roti off of tawa and then place it directly on tawa without struggling with dough’s stickiness; thus making an entire cooking process easy and non-messy. Enjoy it with a South Indian Coconut Chutney and various curries.",
